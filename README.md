# ioRPC

`.NET 4.5+` `Mono`

A minimalistic cross-platform remote procedure call library that works over the standard input/output of processes.

## When to use ioRPC?

When you require Inter-process communication (IPC) on .NET across Windows, Linux and macOS for controlling a subprocess. Pipes would be easier, but is unsupported on Mono.

## Usage

See the `Samples` folder. Contains a basic 'Server' and subprocess 'Client' that implements a basic 'Add' function.
